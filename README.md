# HELL4LEATHER
A game created with Bitsy by J. Connor Kushmer for **DIG4715C**

# TODO

## COMPLAINTS
- [ ] Fix screen size
  - Make full-screen optional (rather than mandatory)
- [ ] Increase contrast between background & tile colors
- [ ] Game is too short; make the game longer
- [ ] Not enough things to interact with [after the first room]
  - [ ] Tell a joke
  - [ ] Leave an easter egg
  - [ ] Keys/progression items

## QUESTIONS UNANSWERED
- [ ] The ending: What happened?
  - [ ] Is it even real? A dream?
  - [ ] The ending was sort of unclear

## NEW SUGGESTIONS
- [ ] Continue game after finding clock(?)
- [ ] Add a maze(?)
- [ ] Alternate ending(?)
  - Get to school on timeâ€”no idea how that would be accomplished, though
